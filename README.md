# 🏠 House Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This is an end-to-end machine learning project that predicts house prices based on input features.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Scaling
4. Model Training (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
5. Model Evaluation (RMSE, R²)
6. Prediction Pipeline

## 🚀 Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

## 📈 Results
Random Forest performed better than Linear Regression with lower RMSE and higher R² score.

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/train.py
python src/evaluate.py
python app.py
